# QTM-350-Final-Project-Spring22
## Project Overview
As students interested in the intersection of the financial markets and the data science world, we are eager to apply analytical and scholarly approaches to finance. 
Particularly, we are fascinated by the financial markets in the last century and want to explore topics such as the historical returns of stock and bond markets during the recession days of 1930s (many researchers omit data from the Great Depression and the second world war to start the analysis in the 1950s). As the global financial market of today undergoes many unprecedented challenges, we want to go back to history and see if any lessons can be discovered.
However, many reports and research back then are not digitized but only available in hard copies of books, newspapers, and other printouts, and it is a demanding process to manually input all the data to digital data frames that computers today can understand
Therefore, we choose to work with Amazon Textract ML service, which can scan the input file, extract the text information, and output as a csv file.

## Option 1: Use the AWS Textract from SageMaker
