# QTM-350 Final Project Spring22
## Amazon Textract
Amazon Textract is an Amazon Web Services ML service that can extract data and text through scanned files, including images, PDFs, and more. It can automatically convert numbers and text to digital files, which is valuable for preservation of information as well as research purposes. In this project, we experimented with text shape (curved v. straight) and the location of data in the file.
